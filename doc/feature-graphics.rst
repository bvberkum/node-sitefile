Image compositing
  Bitmap processing can be done with Imagemagick compositing -- like PlantUML
  can do built-in drop-shadows for any transparent PNG by running some
  compositing.

  See http:/tools/diagram-shadows.sh.

  Use case: dot-diagram shadows
    Background: Requires two graphviz renders and an ImageMagick CLI recipe.
    Going to have convert.filter router take local options for route.
    Need to use path with params, see if glob still kicks in.
