Docco
  Nifty setup, but no support for block comments. [#]_ [#]_

  The idea is pretty good: annotated source-code view of two adjacent panes,
  one for highlighted source-code listing (without comments), and right an
  empty margin with alineas parallel to where the comments where.

  This is not implemented as router but special build setup and route config.
