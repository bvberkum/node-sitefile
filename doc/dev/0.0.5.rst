.. include:: ../.defaults.rst


- Rewrite of all contexts: handler/resolver are merged now. Root context has
  new structures ``paths`` and ``site``. ``paths.routers`` makes it possible
  to load addon routers from custom paths.

  Router initialization extends on regular objects until router is initialized,
  then creates proper subContext. It uses new attributes ``methods`` and
  ``handlers`` in addition to existing ``router`` and ``res``.

- Renamed ``Sitefile.{yaml,json}`` `params` attribute to `options` like
  the object in the `resolver context` to keep term diversity low.

- Refactored ``router.generate`` so it can 1. return data or data callbacks
  iso. Express handlers and 2. only extend the context w/o. providing any
  handler. See `Route feature`_

- Went through all of the ReadMe and split into Manual and Dev docs.
  Began drafting setup and customization guide.

- Added ``grunt build`` with `docco` for document generator,
  and SASS for packaging some default styles.

- Added Twitter bootstrap, jQuery, lodash build with grunt/webpack.
  Removed old `default.js` script.

- New URL path query parsing.

  TODO: Preparing to add `require.js` client.

  FIXME: Sitefile need some knowledge of Style and Script resources, both path
  and URL. Maybe bundle them. Or better use resources exported from routers.

..

  FIXME: tie to a nodelib version!
