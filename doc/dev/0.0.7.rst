0.0.7
=====

- Bypassed r0.0.5 feature changes to get back at stable release.
  (Forked off dev to ``features/baseref`` and reset dev to r0.0.7)
- Started ``0.1`` version prefix to experiment with component versioning.
  Initially targetted to keep support for ``routes`` schema stable, see
  `features/route`_ on `Versioning`, `BWC-mode`.
- Using `neodoc`_ for argument parser now.
- Started on extending r.js client features, dependencies.
- Brought main feature categories back to 3 but added a deeper level.
