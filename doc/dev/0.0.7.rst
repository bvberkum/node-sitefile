0.0.7
=====

- Bypassed r0.0.5 feature changes to get back at stable release.
  (Forked off dev to ``features/baseref`` and reset dev to r0.0.7)
- Started ``0.1`` version prefix to experiment with component versioning.
  Initially targetted to keep support for ``routes`` schema stable, see
  `features/route`_ on `Versioning`, `BWC-mode`.
- Using `neodoc`_ for argument parser now.
- Added config for remote sites, to set CORS. Allowing to run client script or
  get data.

- Started on extending r.js client features, dependencies.
  Client config and routes now allow for local extensions, and mixin components
  from different remote sites (given CORS).
- Now loading more extension components besides ``router`` type: moved some
  util. to ``context-prototype`` mixins, and using ``middleware`` for
  experimenting with Connect.js middleware handlers.

- Restructured docs to better reflect current efforts, and allow for
  ideas and planning. Brought main feature categories back to 3 but added a
  deeper level.

- Building out Sitefile v0 client classes.

  Added microformats for ``live-code``, ``a[href]``.
